##Tube Clock is a DIY project created by AndyMagwayer, which involves building a unique and stylish clock using Nixie tubes. The project is available on GitHub and aims to provide instructions and code for building your own Tube Clock.

## Project Description
The Tube Clock project combines a vintage aesthetic with modern technology to create a captivating time-keeping device. It utilizes Nixie tubes, which are gas-filled display tubes that were popular in the mid-20th century. These tubes feature numerical digits and emit a soft, warm glow when activated, providing a unique and visually appealing way to display the time.

## The project repository contains comprehensive documentation, including a detailed bill of materials, schematics, step-by-step assembly instructions, and source code. The code is written in Arduino, a popular open-source electronics platform, making it accessible and easy to modify for individual preferences or customization.

## In addition to the hardware and software resources, the repository also includes high-quality images of the finished Tube Clock, allowing you to get a clear vision of the end result. The provided documentation ensures that even those with limited electronics experience can follow along and successfully build their own Tube Clock.

## Features
The Tube Clock project offers the following features:

1. Nixie Tube Display: The clock utilizes Nixie tubes, which give it a vintage and retro look, reminiscent of an earlier era.
2. Adjustable Brightness: The brightness of the Nixie tubes can be adjusted to suit personal preference or the lighting conditions of the room.
3. RTC Module: The clock employs a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module, which accurately keeps track of time, even in the event of power loss.
4. Alarm Functionality: The Tube Clock features an alarm feature, allowing you to set an audible alarm to wake you up or remind you of important events.
5. NTP Time Synchronization: The clock can synchronize its time with a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server, ensuring accurate timekeeping.
